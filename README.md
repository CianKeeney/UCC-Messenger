    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>
        This project will investigate the features required by a realtime chat application that is oriented towards students of a university. This       investigation will be completed by reviewing and choosing appropriate chat app features, implementing those, and confirming their suitability through user surveys.
    </p>
  <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        In most colleges, students use a variety of chat applications to talk about the college coursework. This leads to a lot of frustration to find out about college assignments and communicating with other students. My chat application will allow for students to be able to keep a central repository for all college coursework and communication amongst students.
    </p>
    <p>
        Applications are available in the form of popular chat apps and teaching platform software, such as Canvas; however, they have several deficiencies; there is a profusion of services, resulting in disjointed use by the student population. These are also uncontrolled, and self moderated. The organisation of chats, ability to search, associate attachments with messages and ability to organise by topics are all features that would better support students in their studies.
    </p>
    <p>
        The project will investigate the following:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Create a list of potential features and identify the most relevant for a chat app in an educational context.</li>
        <li>Create an implementation of the most appropriate suite of features.</li>
        <li>Evaluate the suite of features to establish their utility in an educational context.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The application will have a native app implementation for the front end and use a suitable technology for backend services.</p>
